GC Content & Body Mass Project — Updated Pipeline & Writing Schedule
Target: Updated manuscript completed by end of March

============================================================
GENERAL PIPELINE WORKFLOW (UPDATED)
============================================================
The overall analysis pipeline will follow this structure:

1) Download genomes from NCBI Datasets
2) Run Compleasm on genomes and generate outputs compatible with BUSCO-style summaries
3) Parse genome + Compleasm outputs with custom scripts and upload results to SQL database
4) Perform statistical analyses and generate figures using downstream scripts

This schedule aligns pipeline refactoring, full reruns, and manuscript revision
without rushing analytical steps.

============================================================
PHASE 1: DATA TRANSFER & BASELINE SETUP
Jan 15 – Jan 26
============================================================
Goals:
- Ensure all data and environments are stable
- Preserve BUSCO-based results for comparison

Tasks:
- Transfer all relevant files between computers:
  * Genome FASTAs
  * Metadata (GC, body mass, species mapping)
  * Scripts and SQL schemas
- Verify file integrity and paths
- Recreate conda environments and confirm versions
- Run existing BUSCO-based pipeline end-to-end
- Archive baseline results (figures, tables, stats)

Deliverables:
- Fully functional baseline pipeline
- Archived BUSCO-based results

============================================================
PHASE 2: PIPELINE REFACTOR — BUSCO → COMPLEASM
Jan 27 – Feb 9
============================================================
Goals:
- Replace BUSCO with Compleasm while preserving output structure

Tasks:
- Install and configure Compleasm - Done
- Select lineage dataset(s) and completeness thresholds - chromosome level, reference, squamata
- Run Compleasm on test genomes - This seems to be running correctly
- Document important files such as:
	full_table.tsv - this gives coordinates that I parse later in the get_cds_from_compleasm	podarcis_muralis_cds_compleasm.fasta - this is output by get_cds_from_compleasm.py
- Update 01_run_compleasm_from_metadata_v9.sh
	the cleanup & archiving section now needs to check if data exists for odb10 or 12
	if data exists then it should not archive but rather skip running compleasm / miniprot for that species
	this function should be looking for
		miniprot gff
		full_table.tsv
		"$species_genus"_cds_compleasm.fasta
- 01_run_compleasm_from_metadata_v13.sh does not work and I think this is a environment problem
	things to do
		remove apicomplexa and others in mb_downloads in dummy folder
		download a new genome Aquilegia reuteri and eudicot database to test run compleasm
		build a new compleasm environment
- 01_run_compleasm_from_metadata_v14 works
	I took  bunch of info on the environment and it is located in /Users/rossoaa/Desktop/dummy/old
	I have moved this to /projects/strength_of_gene_conversion/genomes_database/compleasm_database/old
	next I need to integrate v13 and v14 to get back to a functioning script.

- if the script finds these files it should verify that their path is in the metadata.csv
- if the script does not find these files it should run the appropriate step either
	protein mapping using the odb lineage
	completeness analysis using compleasm
	sequence extraction using 02a_get_cds_from_compleasm_v6.py

- Design BUSCO-compatible summary output:
  * Single-copy completeness
  * Duplicated genes
  * Fragmented / missing
- Update pipeline scripts to consume Compleasm output
	1) compleasm output
	2) cds extraction
	3) multiple sequence alignment across cds
		"please guide me through turning this script into a bash script. I think the point of this script is to check which genomes have Busco results output. "
		
	4) make newick file with iqtree
		look up inputs for iqtree
- Document differences between BUSCO and Compleasm

Deliverables:
- Stable Compleasm module
- BUSCO-like summary output
- Updated pipeline documentation

============================================================
PHASE 3: FULL PIPELINE RUN & SQL INGESTION
Feb 10 – Feb 23
============================================================
Goals:
- Generate final analysis-ready dataset

Tasks:
- Download final genome set from NCBI Datasets
- Run Compleasm across all genomes
- Compute GC content metrics
- Run custom parsing scripts:
  * Merge genome metadata + Compleasm output
  * Upload cleaned data into SQL database
- Perform QC:
  * Missing data
  * Outliers
  * Species mismatches

Deliverables:
- Final SQL tables populated
- QC summary notes

============================================================
PHASE 4: STATISTICS & FIGURE GENERATION
Feb 24 – Mar 9
============================================================
Goals:
- Generate final results and visuals

Tasks:
- Run statistical analyses (GC vs body mass models)
- Test robustness and alternative model formulations
- Compare BUSCO vs Compleasm-based results
- Regenerate all figures:
  * Scatterplots
  * Regression fits
  * Supplementary QC figures

Deliverables:
- Final statistical outputs
- Publication-ready figures

============================================================
PHASE 5: MANUSCRIPT REVISION
Mar 10 – Mar 23
============================================================
Goals:
- Update manuscript text to reflect new analyses

Tasks:
- Update Methods:
  * Genome acquisition (NCBI Datasets)
  * Compleasm justification
  * SQL-based data handling
- Update Results with new values and figures
- Revise tables and captions
- Update supplementary materials

Deliverables:
- Complete revised manuscript draft

============================================================
PHASE 6: POLISH & FINALIZATION
Mar 24 – Mar 31
============================================================
Goals:
- Produce submission-ready manuscript

Tasks:
- Consistency checks (text ↔ figures ↔ tables)
- Final language edits
- Abstract revision
- Save clean and tracked-changes versions
- Prepare version for advisor/collaborators

FINAL DELIVERABLE:
Updated GC content & body mass manuscript completed by end of March.
